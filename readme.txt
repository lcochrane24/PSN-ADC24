This folder contains the files needed to build the PSN-ADC24 4-Channel 24-Bit Analog to digital board. 
See https://www.seismicnet.com/psnadc24/ for more information. I am making this information available 
since they are no longer for sells. This is what is in each of the sub-folders.

BOM - The file sdr24adc_bom.txt is the bill of materials for the board.

gerber - Gerber files to make the PCB. The board is 4 layers with a size of 5.5 x 5.0 inches (13.97 x 12.7 cm ).

hexfiles - Contains the hex files that need to be flashed onto the DspPic CPU.

schematic - Schematics of the board.

src - Source code files.

Please do not contact me directly regarding building this board. For support please use the PSNList Google group at

Thanks,
Larry Cochrane
