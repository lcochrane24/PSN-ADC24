This folder contains the souce code needed to compile the firmware running on the microcontroller. To compile
the code you will need the Microchip MPLAB C30 Compiler. This is the version of the compiler I am using:

gcc version 4.0.3 (dsPIC30, Microchip v3_02) Build date: Nov  9 2007

Once the code is compiled you can use the DspBoot.exe program to load the firmware onto the microcontroller.
Before you can do this you will need to flash the bootloader onto the chip using a programmer that can
flash Microchips's DSPIC microcontrollers. The folder hexfiles contains the bootloader hex file as well
as version 2.5 of the board firmware.

The sub-folder Bootloader contains the asm code of the bootloader.
